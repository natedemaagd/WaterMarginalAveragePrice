The Code folder contains all the R scripts needed to reproduce the results. In this folder is the main Analysis folder, which contains the actual analysis for the project. The Functions folder contains the scripts for functions used within the Analysis files.

The Figures folder contains scripts for figures NOT created within the Analysis scripts. These are mostly generic figures that do not rely on analyzing the water consumption data.

The `00-definitions.R` file specifies the main (default) parameters used to run the code and create figures. These values may be changed in individual files to make comparisons (e.g. smaller vs. larger elasticity values, changes to MUC, etc.).
