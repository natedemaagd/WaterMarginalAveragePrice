The markdown files in this folder perform the main analysis for the project. They rely on functions generated in the Code/Functions folder.

01_optimal_consumption_DWL_current_pricing - Estimate demand curves for individual households, optimal consumption under current block pricing structure, and DWL under current block pricing structure, with considerations for MUC and uncertainty in demand elasticity.

02_revenue_and_alternative_pricing - Simulates changing pricing structure. Using heterogeneous demand curves, what will the effect be of moving to a constant variable price rather than increasing block price plus fixed price? What happens to aggregate consumption and utility revenue?
